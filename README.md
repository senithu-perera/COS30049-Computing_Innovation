## Overview

In this project, we utilize various machine learning algorithms to predict housing prices based on a dataset containing features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training using multiple algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Prediction on new data

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing-market-prediction.git
   cd housing-market-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can run the Jupyter notebooks for each stage of the project. For example, to start with data cleaning, open the `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` notebook.

You can also train and evaluate models using the provided scripts:

```bash
python src/train_model.py
python src/evaluate_model.py
```

## Data

The dataset used in this project is [describe the dataset here, including source and any preprocessing steps]. It contains the following features:

- `feature_1`: Description
- `feature_2`: Description
- `target`: House price

## Models

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- [Other models used]

Each model was tuned and evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².
