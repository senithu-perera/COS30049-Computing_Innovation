# House Price Prediction Project - Hawk Tuah

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction Project**! This repository is designed to explore various models for predicting house prices using different versions of data and machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- **Cleaned DataSets**
  - Contains the cleaned versions of the original datasets, which are used for the machine learning models. <br>
  [Cleaned data Set](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/DataSets)
 
- **Version 1 to Version 7 (Version Control)**
  - Each folder contains a different version of the model or data pre-processing applied.
    - *[Version 1](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/Version%201)* : Initial model development
    - *[Version 2](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/Version%202)* : Improved feature selection
    - *[Version 3](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/Version%203)* : Additional data cleaning
    - *[Version 4](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/Version%204)* : New model approach
    - *[Version 5](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/Version%205)* : Hyperparameter tuning
    - *[Version 6](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/Version%206)* : Advanced modeling
    - *[Version 7](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/Version%207)* : Final model version
  
## How to Use This Repository

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Datasets are available in the `DataSets/` folder.
   - Cleaned datasets are located in the `Cleaned DataSets/` folder.
   
2. **Model Development**:
   - Each version folder (`Version 1` to `Version 7`) contains a separate model development stage.
   - The final version of the model is located in `[Version 7](https://github.com/senithu-perera/CompInno.github.io/tree/main/Version%207)`.
   
3. **Web Interface**:
   - The project has a web interface created with HTML and CSS, which can be found in the root directory (`index.html`, `about.html`, etc.).
   - Navigate to these HTML pages to explore the project results and details about the methodology.

4. **Running the Model**:
   - Open `price_prediction.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment to run the machine learning models.
